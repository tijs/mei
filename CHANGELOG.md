# Changelog

All notable changes to Mei are documented here.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-02

Initial public release for Apple Silicon.

### Added

- Native Swift/MLX OpenAI-compatible server for one local model per process.
- Automatic `auto|generic|ornith` runtime profile selection from model metadata.
- Validated Ornith profile: aligned checkpoint support, prefill step 512, and
  Ornith-only fused gate/up cache disablement.
- Conservative generic profile with experimental compiled decode, rotating KV
  quantization, bounded windows, and SSM anchors disabled by default.
- In-process and optional disk-tier KV/prefix reuse.
- Scoped disposable-cache cleanup and a 20 GiB free-space launch guard.
- Local vMLX patch queue pinned to an immutable upstream revision.
- Focused unit tests and release provenance.

### Release status

This is an initial public, source-first release. The validated runtime target
is macOS 15+ on Apple Silicon with the aligned Ornith 1.5 35B checkpoint. The
model is not bundled. Full model/GPU acceptance requires the local MLX/Metal
runtime and is not reproduced by every CI runner.
